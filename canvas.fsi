/// The interact function can render still images in a window, show animations in a window, and
/// to interact with the user via the keyboard and the mouse. For example,
/// <code>
///    let tree = ellipse darkCyan 2.0 85.0 64.0 |> translate 128.0 128.0
///    let draw _ = make tree
///    let react _ _ = None
///    interact "Render an image" 256 256 None draw react 0
/// </code>
/// The main workhorses of <c>interact</c> are the draw and react functions, which communicate via a user-defined state
/// value. In the above example, the state value is implicitly defined as an integer, since the last argument
/// of interact is of integer type, but both draw and react ignore the state. To make an animation with
/// interact, the react function must react on TimerTicks. Consider the following example,
/// <code>
///    type state = float
///    let tree (i:state) : PrimitiveTree = 
///        ellipse darkCyan 2.0 85.0 64.0 |> translate i i
///    let draw (j: state) : Picture = make (tree j)
///    let react (j: state) (ev:Event) : state option = 
///        match ev with
///            | Event.TimerTick -> Some ((j+1.0)%128.0)
///            | _ -> None
///    let interval = Some 100
///    let initialState = 0.0
///    interact "Render an image" 256 256 interval draw react initialState
/// </code>
/// Here, we define a state type as float, which is the value controlling what to draw. The draw function
/// is then a function, which takes a state and produces a Picture in this case the make of an tree containing
/// an ellipse. The react function is set to listen for TimerTick events. When one such event occurs, it returns
/// the next value of the state wrapped in an option type (Some). Other events may happen, but they are all
/// ignored by returning None. Note that there is no mutable value, which contains the present value of the
/// state. Further, note that the draw function is called inside interact, whenever interact deems it necessary,
/// such as when react has been called to produce a new value of the state.
/// 
/// The function react is called when the following events occur:
///   Key of char - when the user presses a regular key
///   DownArrow - when the user presses the down arrow
///   UpArrow - when the user presses the up arrow
///   LeftArrow - when the user presses the left arrow
///   RightArrow - when the user presses the right arrow
///   Return - when the user presses the return key
///   MouseButtonDown(x,y)- when the user presses the left mouse button
///   MouseButtonUp(x,y) - when the user releases the left mouse button
///   MouseMotion(x,y,relx,rely) - when the user moves the mouse
///   TimerTick - when the requested time interval has passed
/// Note that there is no guarantee that the exact interval has occurred between each TimerTick event, and
/// depending on the computing system being used, there is a lower limit to how fast an event loop can
/// be served.
/// 
/// Finally, the state can be any value, and thus the system offers much flexibility in terms of the
/// communication between the draw and the react function. However, since the programmer (and the user) are only
/// indirectly in control of their communication, it may be useful to think of draw and react as isolated
/// functions. E.g., a call by <c>interact</c> to <c>draw j</c> should produce a Picture for state <c>j</c> regardless of the previous
/// picture or the possible next. Likewise, a call to <c>read j ev</c> should react to the situation specified
/// by <c>j</c> and <c>ev</c> only, and the programmer should concentrate only on what the next event should be
/// given said input.
